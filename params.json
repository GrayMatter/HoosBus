{"name":"Hoosbus","tagline":"The once-beloved real-time transit app for UVa and Charlottesville Area Transit, now open-sourced.","body":"## What's included\r\n\r\nThis repository includes a complete HoosBus app in the \"iOS\" subfolder, as well as a python script in the \"GTFSImporter\" subfolder to convert GTFS data files into a sqlite database used in the app.\r\n\r\n## Compile the app\r\n\r\nIn order to compile the app, you need to have latest XCode installed. Also, you need to have a copy of [BetterTransit](https://github.com/HappenApps/BetterTransit) and make sure the \"BetterTransit\" directory is right beside the \"HoosBus\" directory. This is because HoosBus links the files in BetterTransit using relative paths. \r\n\r\n## App features\r\n\r\n* Show nearby bus stops\r\n* Search for a bus stop by stop name or stop code\r\n* A map view showing nearby stops\r\n* Real-time prediction of all routes running through a bus stop\r\n* A routes view\r\n* Each route has a trip view, which can be inbound or outbound.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to update static transit data\r\n\r\nA single script \"import_gtfs.py\" converts the GTFS data into a sqlite database to be used by the app. To update the database, first download the lastest GTFS data files from Connexionz's website, unzip into \"google_transit\" folder, and run\r\n    \r\n    python import_gtfs.py\r\n\r\nThis creates the database file in the same folder, which can then be copied to the iOS folder.\r\n\r\nYou may also need to update \"routesToDisplay.plist\" with the new routes.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nReleased under the MIT license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
